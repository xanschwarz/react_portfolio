## Description

This app is a work in progress. When it is complete, the ReadMe will be updated.

This repository is for a portfolio app showcasing information about myself and the work I've done. It features a nav bar with links to the following sections: About Me, My Portfolio, Contact Me, and My Resume. The footer shows my email and phone number, as well as links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and resume. Flex boxes and media queries are used throughout for responsive design. Future revisions will add more projects and changes to styling.

You can view the app [here](https://xanschwarz.github.io/react_portfolio/).
